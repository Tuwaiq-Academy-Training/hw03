#Questions and Exercises

## Guidelines 
all these exercises must be done in node files

1. write a program that counts the number of characters in an input given like the example below:
```javascript
input:
'someplace over the rainbow'
output:
'there is 1 of s,m,p,l,c,v,t,h,n,b,w and 2 of a,r and 3 of o and 4 of e
```

2. in the following items there are missing prices, we need to fill each of them, each item's price is equal to the number of charactors multiplied by two, if it is more than one then 3 is added to the price

|item|price| 
-----|-----
|Milk | 8|
|Papers|15|
|Egg|null|
|Cheese|null|
|Tissues|null|
|Biscuits|null|
|Banana|null|
|water|null|
|Bakery|null|
|Bread|null|
|Meat |null|
|Seafood|null|
|Pasta |null|
|Rice|null|
|Oil|null|
|Sauces|null|
|Salad|null|
|Cereals|null|
|Soups |null|
|Canned Goods|null|
|Frozen Foods|null|
|Dairy|null|

calculate the missing prices and show the table again using javascript.

to make it easier to deal with javascript copy the following structure into a variable
```javascript
{Milk : 8,
Papers:17,
Egg:null,
Cheese:null,
Tissues:null,
Biscuits:null,
Banana:null,
water:null,
Bakery:null,
Bread:null,
Meat :null,
Seafood:null,
Pasta :null,
Rice:null,
Oil:null,
Sauces:null,
Salad:null,
Cereals:null,
Soups :null,
Canned_Goods:null,
Frozen_Foods:null,
Dairy:null}
```     
NOTE: Do Not Hardcode the Answers
hint: look up Object methods in javascript.

3. 
```javascript
const names = ['Maram','Khaild','Mohammed']
const ages = [25,30,20]
const jobs = ['project manager','engineer','accountent']
const hobbies = ['swimming','chess','eating']
```
given these array change it's structure to allow you to add more information for each user, meaning that we need to have age, job and hobby for each user as follows:
maram is 25 years old and is a project manager and loves swimming
Khalid is 30 years old and is an engineer and loves chess
Mohammed is 20 years old and is an accountent and loves eating

come up with the structure and code a program to convert these arrays into the structure you came up with.
